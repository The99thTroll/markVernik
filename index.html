					</div>
					<p><strong>Mark Vernik</strong>, also known as <strong>mV</strong> on Discord, is an intelligent member of the Homo Sapien faction from Earth. As with all other Homo Sapiens, Mark consists of two arms, two legs, one torso, a head, and miraculously, an XXXL sized brain.
					He is most notably known for his involvement within the Apple Large Gang and has been a driving financial force behind the Official Peterson Applesauce Association (OPAA). Though that is what he is most known for, Mark has also been a part in several
					smaller, less profitable schemes and organizations.</p>
					<p>Mark is infamously identified by his signature tank profile picture which as of recently has been replaced with mere landscape, much to fans' disappointment. However another signature trade<i>mark</i> of Mark's is his bold, <s>ignorance</s> captious attitude. As a result of such a fearsome
					mentality, others have taken attempts to tame such a vigourous mood. Such attempts has failed however with the most famous example being "The Mark Clause" which was first created by Sticky Hands 'Brino and then adopted by Mr. Sandman.</p>
					<p>Mark's achievement list is rather lengthy as he boats several incredible feats. Among these feats include:</p>
					<ul class="specialList">
						<li>Most Targetted Wargaming Player</li>
						<li>Least Likely To Not Go To Jail For Insurance Fraud</li>
						<li>Best Memer Named Mark Vernik</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p class="roleNote2">Main Article: This one you bozo, why would there be another wikipedia page on Mark?<br>For less information, contact your local <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-vernik-03ab74211/">Mark Vernik</a>.</p>

					<div class="articleLeft">
						<div class="articleLeftInner">
							<img src="img/projectFEP.png" alt="FEP" width="300"/>
						</div>
						Incredibly rare footage of "Company Yelp Review Anlalyzer"<br>in action and creating scuffed, not really JSON output.
					</div>

					<h3>Other Entrepreneurial Journeys</h3>
					<p>
						Mark Vernik while incredibly well known for his exploits within the OPAA, he has had other, less known and less successful operations. One of these was the "Company Yelp Review Anlalyzer" (okay I actually have no clue what the heck this one was called but lets roll with it).
						The idea behind this glorious idea that had come from Mark's massive brain was to analyze a company's google or yelp reviews and then point out the most important flaws/boons of the business. There was only one problem for Mark... Sticky Hands 'Brino. Unfortunately, due to 'Brino's
						less than passable work ethic, the project flopped due to a lack of updates. However, there are rumors that Mark has moved on and picked up the fragments of what he accomplished and is now working with Toyam Budiner in order to raise the project back from the dead and into the glory it
						had been promised.
						<br>
						Fragments of the project's planning can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dpIHPFqOBuSy9-MWhx1tEvsTPfnWeLjMSf_JibalBO4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGJTAbF9DetcKGTgjnIY8QXWjhKowYdDumhfQAXmpeU/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a>,
						and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ts34TtRx60DDVnU46SoxDiPvtTw7UMANqYSRDoiBmdk/edit">here</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Moving past this failure, one would expect that Mark would move on and understand that Sticky Hands 'Brino is not to be trusted. As brilliant Mark is, I guess he's kinda dense... This time is was Sticky Hands 'Brino who had the idea. They would be selling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Finest-Chocolate-Fundraising-Variety/dp/B07K1H3ZZX">World's Finest Chocolate</a> 
						to students in their school. For whatever reason, Mark decided he wanted to be an investor in this project. With many back and forth talks, discussions of royalties and whatnot, a deal was finally brokered. All this just for 'Brino not to follow through and drop the investment due to
						a lack of accessable funds and a lack of confidence on their side. Hopefully Mark sees the failures with 'Brino and will continue to outsource work for his further deals.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Leaving The Apple Large Gang</h3>
					<p>Okay this section title is more or less a lie lmao. Mark Vernik has <b>NOT</b> fully left The Apple Large Gang; He as only left physically but continues to engage virtually with the occassional in person apparition. Due to unfortunate circumstances following the end of 9th grade, Mark was forced to transfer high schools (where he now lives the rich life) and as such, leave
					the daily meetings of The Apple Large Gang. He still participates daily on the legendary Google Chats where his tomfoolery goes unchecked and his mortar nemesis Abe is nowehere to be found. Additionally Mark has established a niche on Twitter which
					Toyam Budiner has taken advantage of, compiling a series of Mark's tweets into a website for any to browse.</p>
		
					<h2>Wargaming Career</h2>
					<div class="articleRight">
						<div class="articleRightInner">
							<img src="img/markFinancialSuccess.png" alt="markFinaces" width="200"/>
						</div>
						Mark absolutely destroying and establishing economical dominance<br>upon his fellow players in The Stonks Game: Vodka Edition
					</div>
					<p>To this day, Mark still stands as a legendary Wargaming Player as he creates fearsome strategies and often violates all attempts at the Mark Clause in order to get his way. Like seriously, Mark will pester you for 7 frickin' days trying to get you to see his point of view; there ain't no stopping him mate.
					While his economical side is unmatched by any, his constant clashes with moderators often lead to unsuccessful campaigns in warfare based games. <b>Like that time he failed to take Italy in 2 days</b>. That specific event put a large dent in Mark's self confidence and led to a temper outbreak leading to him abandoning
					said wargaming which at the time of writing this, has its name unknown.
					</p>

						<div class="articleLeftInner">
							<img src="img/markWarFail2.png" alt="markFail" height="50"/>
						</div>
						Mark's warfare failures resulting from the Anti-Mark Chats.
					</div>
					<h3>Rise of Anti-Mark Chats</h3>
					<p>There was another critical factor that led to the tragic downfall of Mark during wargamings: The Dreaded Anti-Mark Chats. While one may quickly assume it was his long standing rival Abe who organized his peers into a gang against him, it was actually Mark's good friend Sticky Hands 'Brino who was to blame! The reasoning
						behing this? "Just a spot of minor tomfoolery" said 'Brino <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>.
					</p>
					<p>The aim of said chats was the prevent Mark from reaching success as much as possible. Now in the beginning this was an honorable goal as Mark was actually good at the game (he did not have a skill issue back then) but as time went on, the Anti-Mark Chats were far too overused to the point where people would specifically add
						Mark to these chats in order to derail the operation. With time, these chats faded in oblivion with not many still active. There are myths of one known as "Anti-Mark Chat B-Day Edition" which has been utilized recently but if that's true remains unclear.
					</p>

					<h2>Noteworthy Screenshots</h2>
					<p>In the history of Mark's grand career there have been many notable moments in his life that have been captured live on camera, in 4k, at 3 am, all while calling the sussy among us police (real)<br>The following images are just a few of such moments:</p>
